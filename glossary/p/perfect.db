A perfect number is equal to the sum of its divisors; eg
\par
6 = 1 + 2 + 3,
\par
28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14

\par
Not many perfect numbers are known, because they become very big very
soon. But there is a formula for generating some of them, known since Euclid's
time: add together a series of powers of 2 until you get a prime number, and
then multiply by the last power of two you used.
\par
eg, $2^{0}+2^{1}+2^{2}=1+2+4=7,$  which is prime;
multiply by 4 to get 28, which is perfect.
\par
All the known perfect number are even.
