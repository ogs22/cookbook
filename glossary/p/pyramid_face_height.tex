The face height of a pyramid is the distance from the apex to 
the centre of one of the base's edges.
\par
A pyramid whose base is a regular n-gon with side length
x and whose apex is directly above
the centre of the base, has face height f. 
\par
to find f, note that the short radius of a regular n-gon is
$ r = \frac{x \tan \theta }{2} , $ where $ \theta = 90 - \frac{180}{n} . $
Then we have $f^{2}=h^{2}+r^{2},$  where h is the height of the pyramid.
\par
So $ f = \sqrt{h^2 + \frac{x^2 \tan ^2 \theta }{4} } . $
