The set of all permutations of a given set X, together with the
operation of composition of functions. It can be shown that this 
is always a group; it is denoted P(X).
\par
The identity operation I(X) is the identity element of P(X);
the inverse operation of a given permutation is that
permutation's inverse in the group.
\par
The set X may be finite or infinite.
