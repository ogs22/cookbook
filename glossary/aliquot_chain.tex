For a given number, we can form an aliquot sequence by
summing the number's divisors (excluding itself) to form
a new number, and then repeating this process indefinitely.
\par
For some starting numbers the aliquot sequence will 
eventually cycle (such a cycle is called a sociable chain),
for some it will increase, apparently forever. It is not known 
whether any aliquot sequences actually increase without limit.
\par
For example, it is not known what the aliquot chain starting 
at 276 does in the long run.
