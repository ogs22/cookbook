\begin{itemize}
  \item The formula $e^{\mathrm{i}x}  = \cos x + \mathrm{i} \sin x$, where
$\mathrm{i}$ is the square root of -1. A special case is
 $ \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\pi } = -1. $

  \item The formula, also called Euler's theorem: V - E + F = 2, which relates
    the number of vertices V, edges E, and faces F in a polyhedron.
